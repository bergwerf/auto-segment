Auto-Segment plugin for ImageJ
==============================
To compile and run, execute `mvn -Pexec` from the command line.

This is related to `bergwerf/deepnetj` and was an attempt to incorporate a specific Keras model into ImageJ. I do not rememeber exactly to what extent it does anything useful.
